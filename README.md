# Heavy resonances, Top-Philic model

To search for new resonances that modify the $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production we look into the Top-Philic model for heavy resonances. A total of six simplify models are introduce which adds a new boson that coupling mostly to top quarks.  

*  **Scalar color-singlet boson (S_{1})**: Contains the interactions and particles corresponding to a scalar, singlet of color, top-philic particle

*  **Pseudoscalar color-singlet boson (P_{1})**: Contains the interactions and particles corresponding to a pseudoscalar, singlet of color, top-philic particle

*  **Vector color-singlet boson (V_{1})**: Contains the interactions and particles corresponding to a vector, singlet of color, top-philic particle

*  **Scalar color-octet boson (S_{8})**: Contains the interactions and particles corresponding to a scalar, octet of color, top-philic particle

*  **Pseudoscalar color-octet boson (P_{8})**: Contains the interactions and particles corresponding to a pseudoscalar, octet of color, top-philic particle

*  **Vector color-octet boson (V_{8})**: Contains the interactions and particles corresponding to a vector, octet of color, top-philic particle.
